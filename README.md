This repository contains code for the blog post [Phishytics â€“ Machine Learning for Detecting Phishing Websites](https://faizanahmad.tech/blog/2020/02/phishytics-machine-learning-for-phishing-websites-detection/). Using Random Forests on top of Byte Pair Encoding and TFIDF scores, we can obtain a highly accurate model for predicting phishing websites. Pre-trained models are also provided for users and companies to use.
