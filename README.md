# Phishytics - Machine Learning for Detecting Phishing Websites
Machine Learning and Random Forests with Byte Pair Encoding and TFIDF scores for Phishing Website Detection.

![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-green.svg?style=plastic)

This repository contains code for the blog post [Phishytics â€“ Machine Learning for Detecting Phishing Websites](https://faizanahmad.tech/blog/2020/02/phishytics-machine-learning-for-phishing-websites-detection/). Using Random Forests on top of Byte Pair Encoding and TFIDF scores, we can obtain a highly accurate model for predicting phishing websites. Pre-trained models are also provided for users and companies to use.
